                    <hr>
              <h3>Long popular in Europe, electric-assist bicycles are finally gaining ground in the United States and opening up a world of adventure to cyclists of all skill levels.</h3>
              <p>I almost hesitated when I got the chance to try my first electric-assist bike on a tour of Monterey Bay. The whipping wind, the hilly central California countryside, the need to keep up with a group on a longer bike ride than I’d taken in months—it was all daunting. Ultimately, my curiosity won out, and as I turned into a headwind that came off Spanish Bay, I quickly discovered the technology’s allure. As I pedaled hard, my bike—a Turbo Como 2.0 from Specialized—gave back in equal measure. The harder I worked, the harder the motor worked, and I zipped forward with an ease I could get used to. I let out an elated whoop, laughing like a kid conquering two wheels for the first time.</p>
              <p>Electric-assist bicycles have been popular in Europe for about 10 years, according to Dominik Greyer, Specialized’s product manager for the Turbo, and in 2017, more than 2.3 million e-bikes were sold on the continent. Until recently, however, electric bikes were relatively unheard of in the United States and looked down on by local hard-core cyclists.</p>
              <figure class="figure"><img src="img/riders.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" width="100%"><figcaption class="figure-caption">Photo by James Perry<br>
                <span>E-bikes allow people of different experience levels to enjoy rides together.</span> </figcaption></figure>
                <hr>
              <p>Even among those who had heard the phrase “e-assist,” the concept was prone to misunderstanding. Despite the fact that the bikes use a battery-powered motor that’s only activated by pedaling, people pictured noisy throttles and gasoline engines. “It was seen as not really biking,” says Tania Burke, president of the cycling outfitter Trek Travel. “But it’s not like a moped. You have to pedal. [The motor] is just there to assist you.”</p>
              <p>E-bikes have finally started shedding their stigma in the United States, and in 2018 they’re poised to change the way you travel here. Greyer notes that, although the bikes were designed with the 35 and over crowd in mind, they are now also making headway with a young generation of riders who embrace technology. Sales are soaring: Specialized is seeing a 90 percent increase over last year.</p>
              <p>Why the sudden love affair with pedal-assist bicycles?</p>
              <p>The appeal lies in their ability to level the playing field. They let couples, friends, and family who have different fitness and experience levels travel together. They give people just enough boost to try routes otherwise outside their comfort zones. And because riders don’t tire as quickly, they stay in the saddle longer.</p>
              <p class="quote">“I call it a game-changer for so many people.”</p>
              <p>Most travelers have their first encounter with e-bikes on a long-distance tour. More than two-thirds of Trek Travel customers who opt for e-bikes on a Trek trip are new to bicycle touring, often accompanying a more experienced friend or partner. Burke recalls a trip along one of her favorite cycling routes through Tuscany’s rolling countryside with her mother-in-law. “She was riding with me up the climb, and we had a ball. She most likely wouldn’t have been able to do that had she not been on an e-bike. I call it a game-changer for so many people,” she says.</p>
              <p>For the past several years, bike tour companies like Trek Travel and DuVine Cycling + Adventure Co. have watched requests climb. In 2016, 66 DuVine customers used e-bikes on tours. In 2017, that number had jumped to 153 and is predicted to exceed 200 by the end of this year. “Our guests are loving electric assist,” says founder Andy Levine. “E-bikes . . . are great equalizers.”</p>
              <p>Multi-day adventures also offer experienced riders the chance to sample the technology without committing, so DuVine and Trek Travel now bring e-bikes on most of their tours, even if they’re not requested.</p>
              <p>But the bikes aren’t just useful for travelers who want to log miles in rolling rural landscapes. They’re becoming an increasingly popular option for revving up a day trip.</p>
              <p>Dockless electric-assist bike sharing programs, such as JUMP in San Francisco and Washington, D.C., are becoming more popular with local commuters and independent tourists. Darting through D.C.’s traffic or tackling the Bay Area’s hills on a regular bike can be too much for most residents, let alone visitors, but the boost of the pedal-assist makes this type of active urban travel more accessible.</p>
              <p>Bike shops and outfitters across the country are starting to incorporate e-bikes into their guided local tours too. Mad Dogs & Englishmen, opened earlier this year in Carmel-by-the-Sea, can coordinate a morning e-bike ride taking in Monterey’s historic sites in chronological order (which isn’t possible on foot) or an afternoon e-bike ride along California’s famous 17-mile drive. In Colorado Springs, Amp’d Adventures guides 60-minute to three-hour fat-tire e-bike tours that wind on- and off-road through the juniper-laden foothills and candy cane sandstone spires of the Garden of the Gods.</p>
              <p>The biking community in the mountains has been the slowest to accept e-bikes, but even that is changing. Last summer, Steamboat Ski & Resort in northern Colorado opened its mountain bike park to guided e-bike lessons and tours. And on May 25, Mammoth Bike Park  will become the first U.S. Forest Service bike park to permit electric-assist bikes. Just as they do on the road, e-bikes open up the mountains to people of varying experience and fitness levels.</p>
              <p>DuVine’s Andy Levine says that e-bikes “make a dream vacation a reality.”</p>

              <h3>When the flow of travelers slowed to a trickle after an earthquake struck the city in 2017, 10 boutique hotels, similar in style and service, united for a cause: survival.</h3>
              <p>After a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck Mexico City on September 19, 2017, tourism numbers tumbled and hotels suffered the consequences. Faced with empty rooms and very few future reservations, Alan Favero—the owner of the eight-room, eco-friendly El Patio 77, in the San Rafael neighborhood—sprung into action, spearheading a platform called Hoteles de Barrio that officially launched last month.</p>

                  <p>The idea was to unite a group of 10 properties around the city that share a similar design aesthetic and commitment to service. “We have a beautiful hotel, but there are a lot of hotels like us that are fighting for the market. I thought that if we came together as a group, we could promote ourselves and be more powerful,” he says. </p>

                  <p>Power in numbers was certainly a motivating factor for Ana Leticia Reyes, the owner of Casa Goliana, in Roma Norte, to join. “We can present a united front in order to be heard by promoters of local tourism, who usually deal with large chains,” she says. “Before, it was difficult to approach them individually.”</p>
                  <p>Right now, Hoteles de Barrio is just a website and a hashtag—but the goal is to turn it into a designation that carries the same weight as, say, the Berlin-based boutique-hotel consortium, Design Hotels. “We don’t want to be seen as super luxury, but rather small, artsy hotels that are well-designed and really local,” Favero says. “And it’s also about the experience and quality of personalized service we provide.” While there is no set list of criteria, the hotels are all relatively small, ranging from the 36-room Hotel Carlota to La Valise, which has just three rooms. And many are located in meticulously and beautifully restored historic buildings, giving you the feeling that you’re staying in a private home.</p>
                  <p>According to Regina Montes, the owner of the intimate Nima Local House in Roma Norte, the group gets together often to “brainstorm innovative ideas on how to improve our guests’ experiences.” This might mean, say, partnering with chefs to spend time in their kitchens or visiting farmers and helping them harvest. Eventually, the website will feature maps and guides, as well as blog posts with recommendations from the property owners and employees. </p>
                  <p>To spread the word, they’re starting with a newsletter that will go to each of their databases. The group is also planning to create promotions and deals around booking nights at more than one participating hotel—a move that plays to the sprawling nature of the Mexico City metropolitan area. And the properties are now willing and able to recommend each other as alternatives if they’re at capacity. As for the future, they may add a booking engine to the site, and Favero hopes to grow beyond the initial members—and even expand to nearby destinations such as San Miguel de Allende and Oaxaca City.</p>
                  <p>“We are committed to the promotion of our neighborhoods and its small merchants—from restaurants, bars, and bakeries to cultural centers,” says Ana Leticia Reyes. “And by sharing our secrets, we are directly enriching the experience of visitors.”</p>

                <h3>Overtourism is becoming a serious problem around the world. Here’s how outfitters are working to be part of the solution.</h3>
                <p>Travelers often complain about crowds and are always looking for a way to avoid them. But the people who live in very popular places know that those crowds don’t ever go away. While residents may enjoy a real economic benefit from visitors, unchecked tourism has also caused overcrowding, put a strain on local resources, and in some cases, decreased a region’s livability.</p>
                <p>Last summer’s anti-tourism protests in Venice, Barcelona, and other European cities marked a breaking point for residents of those communities: The negative impacts of overtourism were outweighing the benefits of their tourism dollars. Around the world, popular destinations have started taking steps to address the issue. Peru began limiting the amount of time visitors can spend in the ruins of Machu Picchu, and some U.S. national parks are considering requiring time-specific reservations.</p>
                <figure class="figure"><img src="img/statue-crowd.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" width="100%"><figcaption class="figure-caption">Photo by Rostislav Glinsky/Shutterstock<br>
                  <span>Tourists pack into the historic center of Venice near Piazza San Marco.</span> </figcaption></figure>
                  <hr>
                <p>Several tour outfitters are joining the fight, too, adjusting their itineraries to minimize impact on popular places, while still offering access to the destination’s most appealing characteristics.</p>
                <h3>Off-season and off-the-beaten-path trips</h3>
                <p>Intrepid Travel now focuses on running trips to Europe between October and March, which is considered the off-season. It has also launched trips to less-visited places, including Finland, Poland, Belarus, Moldova, and Cyprus, as well as off-the-tourist-trail areas like southern Morocco instead of Marrakech, or northern Peru instead of Machu Picchu.</p>
                <p>The highlight of my recent Intrepid Travel Morocco Atlas and Atlantic trip was visiting the town of Tafraoute in the Anti-Atlas Mountains. The heart of the Berber homeland is far from the bustling souks and resorts of Morocco, and while most tourists head north of Marrakech, we’d gone south. I wandered among uncrowded babouche and jewelry shops, talked with women in argan oil co-operatives, and got to know residents over coffee in local cafés—all while being one of only a handful of visitors in town.</p>
                <p>Another focus for tour companies is bringing travelers beyond the typical tourist destinations to places where they can immerse themselves in local culture. Exodus Travels encourages travelers headed to Peru to embark on the Moonstone Trek, rather than the popular Inca Trail. Moonstone hikers share the path with Peruvians instead of other tourists. In Croatia, Exodus Travels puts another local spin on a popular destination with its Dalmatian Coast cycling trip: While travelers may end their route in Dubrovnik, they spend the majority of their days in small villages.</p>
                <h3>Smaller groups</h3>
                <p>Travel in small groups is another way tour operators address overcrowding. With fewer people, they can tread lightly, leaving less of a mark on the destination, especially in places where the infrastructure can’t handle lots of visitors.</p>
                <p class="quote">“With fewer people, [small groups] can tread lightly, leaving less of a mark on the destination.”</p>
                <p>National Geographic Expeditions has designed many of its active expeditions to take small groups of travelers to areas where not many tourists go. Its Iceland: Volcanoes, Glaciers, and Whales Adventure goes way beyond the overcrowded Golden Circle to the far eastern and northern parts of the island; its Alaska Sea Kayaking Adventure gives guests the opportunity to explore Glacier Bay by kayak—an intimate approach that avoids the crowds and the carbon footprint of big cruise ships.</p>
                <h3>Local guides and experiences</h3>
                <p>The appeal of notable destinations doesn’t just go away, and even though savvy travelers are willing to choose alternative adventures, popular cities still draw plenty of visitors. How do tour operators address the thirst for those top 10 places?</p>
                <p>“The tsunami of people pouring through the city on a cruising day adventure changes the dynamic [of a place], and dipping your toe in for a couple of hours without much help to the economy of that place only highlights the negative impact,” says Leigh Barnes, North America regional director for Intrepid Travel. “We consider the balance of going to those destinations that are popular, but we also make sure that tourist dollars get to the local economy.”</p>
                <figure class="figure"><img src="img/glacier.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" width="100%"><figcaption class="figure-caption">Photo by Sergey Yechikov/Shutterstock<br>
                  <span>You just can’t get this close to an iceberg on the deck of a cruise ship.</span> </figcaption></figure>
                  <hr>
                <p>Many tour operators employ local guides—they’re resources on the ground who have a deep understanding of the culture and a familiarity with the area that clues them into the best times to visit places on a tour itinerary. With the help of Youssef Laamimi, a trip leader for Intrepid Travel’s Urban Adventures, I not only learned to navigate the intimidating souks of Marrakech, but also visited the avenues few visitors investigate: those inhabited by the makers of the goods sold in the souks. There, I tried my hand at weaving leather pieces into sandals and learned to appreciate a craft that is often unseen by those haggling for the best bargain in the market.</p>
                <p>In trying to be part of the overtourism solution, rather than part of the problem, outfitters are actually enabling their guests to experience all the parts of a culture rather than bungeeing in to grab and go—which is really what experiential travelers have wanted all along.</p>

                    the waiter what it means, a real-time translation app will save all of this kerfuffle. All you have to
                    do is open the app, point your camera at the text you want translated and the app will work its magic
                    to give you a quick translation. Real-time translation apps (I personally use the classic Google Translate)
